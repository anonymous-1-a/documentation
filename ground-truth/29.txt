The process comprises two steps that are executed concurrently.
In step 1, if condition c1 is satisfied, two actions take place simultaneously. The first action involves performing activity a_1, while the second action entails determining whether condition c4 is met. If condition c4 is met, execute activity a_3. Then determine once again whether condition c4 is met. Cycle this process until condition c4 is not met. However, if condition c1 is not met, activity a_4 is performed instead.
In step 2, the process follows a sequential set of steps. Initially, condition c3 is continuously evaluated until it is no longer true. Once condition c3 holds true, five activities, namely a_7, a_8, a_9, a_10, and a_11, are simultaneously carried out. After the loop, activity a_12 is performed. If condition c2 is true, the process continuously checks condition c5 until it becomes false. When condition c5 evaluates to true, activity a_14 is executed. Conversely, if condition c2 is not true, activity a_15 is performed. Finally, activities a_16 and a_17 are carried out, marking the conclusion of the process.
