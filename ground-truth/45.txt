The process will begin by executing activity a_1. After that, check to see if condition c1 is met. Determine whether condition c2 is satisfied if condition c1 is met. If condition c2 is met, perform activity a_4. Then, continue to judge condition c2 and repeat the process until condition c2 is not satisfied. Once this loop procedure is complete, return to assessing whether condition c1 is satisfied and repeat until condition c1 is not satisfied.
