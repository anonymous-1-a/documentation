The progression of the process relies on the satisfaction of condition c1. If condition c1 is fulfilled, the subsequent steps are contingent upon the fulfillment of condition c2. In the event that condition c2 is met, four activities a_1, a_2, a_3, and a_4 will be executed simultaneously. However, if condition c2 is not satisfied, activities a_5 and a_6 will be performed sequentially, with a_5 preceding a_6. In either case, activity a_7 must be executed afterwards.
On the other hand, if condition c1 is not met, activity a_8 will be performed instead. This conditional structure ensures that the process flows in a manner that aligns with the status of condition c1 and c2, enabling appropriate actions to be taken accordingly.
