The progression of the process depends on the fulfillment of condition c1. In the event that condition c1 is satisfied, activity a_1 will be executed accordingly. However, if condition c1 is not met, the process will proceed differently.
Firstly, Check to see if condition c2 is met. If condition c2 is satisfied, perform activity a_6. Then, check again to see if condition c2 is met. This process should be repeated until condition c2 is not met. After condition c2 is not met, activity a_7 will be carried out, followed by activity a_8.
