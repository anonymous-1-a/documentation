If condition c1 is met, activity a_1 will be executed. If condition c1 is not met, two steps will be taken simultaneously. The first step involves executing activity a_2. The second step involves checking if condition c2 is met. If condition c2 is met, activity a_3 will be executed only if condition c3 is also met. However, if condition c3 is not met, activity a_4 will be executed instead. If condition c2 is not met, activity a_5 will be executed.
