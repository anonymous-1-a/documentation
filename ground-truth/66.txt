If condition c1 is met, two activities, a_1 and a_2, will be executed simultaneously. However, if condition c1 is not met, judge whether condition c3 is met, and if it is met, perform the following activity: Determine whether condition c4 is met. If condition c4 is met, execute activity a_11. Then determine once again whether condition c4 is met. Cycle this process until condition c4 is not met. After these activities are completed, continue to determine whether condition c3 is met, loop this process, and stop when c3 is not met.
