If condition c1 is met, determine whether condition c2 is met. If condition c2 is met, execute activity a_3. Then determine once again whether condition c2 is met. Cycle this process until condition c2 is not met. After the loop ends, activity a_4 is executed. However, if c1 is not met, activity a_5 will be executed.
