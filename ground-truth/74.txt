If condition c1 is satisfied, determine whether condition c3 is met. If condition c3 is met, execute activity a_4. Then determine once again whether condition c3 is met. Cycle this process until condition c3 is not met. On the other hand, if condition c1 is not satisfied, the system will check the truth value of condition c2. If c2 is true, activity a_5 will be executed. In case c2 is not true, the system will execute four steps concurrently, involving activities a_6, a_7, a_8, and a_9. After the successful completion of these steps, two activities, namely a_10 and a_11, will be executed simultaneously. Throughout this process, the sequence of checking conditions and executing activities will be carried out accurately and in accordance with the specified requirements.
