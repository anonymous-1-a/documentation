If condition c1 is satisfied, determine whether condition c3 is met. If condition c3 is met, execute activity a_2. Then determine once again whether condition c3 is met. Cycle this process until condition c3 is not met. Conversely, if condition c1 is not satisfied, the system will proceed to check the fulfillment of condition c2. If condition c2 is met, activity a_3 will be executed. However, if condition c2 is not met, activity a_4 will be executed instead.
