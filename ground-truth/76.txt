When condition c1 is satisfied, four steps will be executed concurrently. The first step entails performing activity a_1, while the second step involves the sequential execution of two activities: first, activity a_2 will be performed, followed by activity a_3. The third step, activity a_4 will be executed, and, in the fourth step, activity a_5 will be carried out.

In the event that condition c1 is not fulfilled, the process will follow a specific sequence of steps. Initially, if condition c2 is met, activity a_6 will be executed. However, if condition c2 is not met, activity a_7 is executed first. When activity a_7 is executed, activity a_8 is executed. Subsequently, if condition c3 is satisfied, activity a_9 will be executed; otherwise, activity a_10 will be executed instead.
