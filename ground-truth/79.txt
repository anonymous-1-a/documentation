We will be carrying out three steps at the same time. The first step involves executing activity a_1, while the second step involves executing activity a_2. For the third step, we will check if condition c1 is fulfilled. If it is, we will then check if condition c2 is also met. If both conditions are met, we will carry out activity a_3. However, if c2 is not met, we will proceed with five simultaneous steps, which involve executing activities a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, and a_8. On the other hand, if c1 is not satisfied, we will simply execute activity a_9.
