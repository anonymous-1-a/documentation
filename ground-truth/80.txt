The process will follow these steps in order: First, activity a_1 will be executed. Then, activity a_2 will be executed. Next, determine whether condition c1 is met. If condition c1 is met, execute activity a_4. Then determine once again whether condition c1 is met. Cycle this process until condition c1 is not met. Determine whether condition c2 is met. If it is met, execute the following activity: Determine whether condition c3 is met. If condition c3 is met, execute activities a_8 and a_9 simultaneously. Then determine once again whether condition c3 is met. Cycle this process until condition c3 is not met. After these activities are completed, continue to determine whether condition c2 is met, loop this process, and stop when c2 is not met.
