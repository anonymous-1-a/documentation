 First, activity a_1 will be executed. Then, determine whether condition c4 is met, and if so, proceed to activity a_6, and then continue to determine condition c4. Repeat these two steps and end when condition c4 is not met.
 After the loop, four steps will be carried out simultaneously.
 1. Activity a_7 is executed first, then a_8. If condition c2 is satisfied, activity a_9 is executed; otherwise, activity a_10.
 2. Execute activity a_11.
 3. Execute activity a_12.
 4. Execute activity a_13.
 When these parallel tasks are finished, determine whether condition c3 is satisfied. If condition c3 is satisfied, perform activity a_14; otherwise, perform activity a_15.
