If condition c1 is met, four steps will be carried out simultaneously:
1. Execute activity a_1;
2. Execute activity a_2;
3. Execute activity a_3;
4. Firstly, Activities a_4, a_5, and a_6 will be conducted simultaneously. After these activities are completed, determine whether condition c3 is met. If condition c3 is met, execute activity a_8, and then continue to determine condition c3. This process is looped and ends when condition c3 is not satisfied, and then it is determined whether condition c2 is met. If condition c2 is satisfied, perform activity a_9; otherwise, perform activity a_10. After executing a_9 or a_10, execute activities a_11 and a_12;

However, if condition c1 is not met, activity a_13 will be executed.
