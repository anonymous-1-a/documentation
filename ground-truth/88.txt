The following two tasks will be performed at the same time:
The first step involves checking if condition c1 is met. If it is, activity a_1 will be executed. If c1 is not met, then activity a_2 will only be executed if c2 is fulfilled. If c2 is not fulfilled, then activity a_3 will only be executed if c3 is met. If c3 is not met, then activity a_4 will be executed instead.
The second step involves executing activity a_5.
