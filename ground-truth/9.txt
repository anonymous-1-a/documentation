First, activity a_1 will be executed.
Then, if condition c1 is met, activity a_17 will be executed, followed by activity a_4. If condition c2 is met, activity a_5 will be carried out, but if not, activity a_6 will be executed instead. Finally, activity a_7 will be executed. However, if condition c1 is not met, four steps will be carried out simultaneously. The first step is to determine whether condition c4 is met, and if it is, execute activity a_9. Then continue to determine whether condition c4 is met. Cycle this process until condition c4 is not met. The second step involves executing activity a_10 if condition c3 is met, but if not, activity a_11 will be executed instead. The third step involves executing activity a_12, and the fourth step involves executing activity a_18.
