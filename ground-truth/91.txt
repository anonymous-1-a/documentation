If condition c1 is met, determine whether condition c3 is met. If condition c3 is met, execute activity a_2, and then continue to determine condition c3. Repeat this process and end when condition c3 is not satisfied. However, if condition c1 is not met, check if condition c2 is satisfied. If condition c2 is met, determine whether condition c4 is met. If condition c4 is met, execute activity a_4, and then continue to determine condition c4. Repeat this process and end when condition c4 is not satisfied. If c2 is not met, two steps will be executed simultaneously. The first step involves running activity a_5, while the second step involves executing a series of activities: 1. Activity a_6. 2. Activity a_7. 3. Activity a_8. 4. Activity a_9. 5. Activity a_10.
