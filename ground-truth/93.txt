First, it will execute activity a_23. Then, if condition c1 is met, it will execute activity a_4, followed by activity a_5. However, if condition c1 is not met, determine whether condition c5 is satisfied. If condition c5 is satisfied, execute activity a_8, and then continue to judge condition c5. Repeat this process and end when condition c5 is not satisfied. After condition c1 has been judged and the relevant activity has been executed, determine whether condition c3 is met. If the condition is met, execute activity a_13, and then continue to determine condition c3. Repeat this process and end when condition c3 is not satisfied. After discontinuing the implementation of activity a_13, determine whether condition c4 is met. If condition c3 is met, perform the following activities: determine whether condition c6 is satisfied. If the condition is satisfied, execute activity a_19, and then continue to judge condition c6. Repeat this process and end when condition c6 is not satisfied. Then return to continue judging condition c4. Repeat this process and end when condition c4 is not satisfied. Finally, the system will execute activity a_24.
