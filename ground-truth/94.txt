1. Determine whether condition c3 is met. If condition c3 is met, perform the following activities: Determine whether condition c4 is satisfied. If the condition is satisfied, execute activity a_7, and then continue to judge condition c4. Repeat this process and end when condition c4 is not satisfied. Then return to continue judging condition c3. Repeat this process and end when condition c3 is not satisfied.
2. Execute activity a_8. 
3. Two steps will occur simultaneously. The first step involves Determine whether condition c5 is met. If the condition is met, execute activity a_10, and then continue to determine condition c5. Repeat this process and end when condition c5 is not satisfied. The second step will proceed as follows: if condition c2 is met, perform activity a_11. If not, perform activity a_12 instead. At the end of the implementation of activities a_11 and a_12, execute activities a_13, a_14, a_15, a_16, and a_17 simultaneously.
