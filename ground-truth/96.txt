There are three steps that will happen at the same time.
In the first step, if condition c1 is true, activity a_1 will be done. If c1 is not true, the system will check if c2 is true. If c2 is true, the system will keep determining whether condition c6 is met. If the condition is met, execute activity a_3, and then continue to determine condition c6. Repeat this process and end when condition c6 is not satisfied. If c2 is not true, activities a_4, a_5, a_6, and a_7 will be done at the same time.
In the second step, activity a_8 will be done.
In the third step, the system will continuously determine whether condition c4 is satisfied. If condition c4 is satisfied, perform the following activities: Determine whether condition c5 is met. If the condition is met, execute activity a_16, and then continue to determine condition c5. Repeat this process and end when condition c5 is not satisfied. Then return to continue judging condition c4. Repeat this process and end when condition c4 is not satisfied.
