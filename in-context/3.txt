If condition c1 is met, determine whether condition c2 is met. If condition c2 is met, enter a loop. In the loop, determine whether condition c3 is met. If condition c3 is met, execute activities a_2 and a_3 simultaneously. After executing activities a_2 and a_3, determine whether condition c3 is met again. The loop ends when condition c3 is not satisfied. If condition c2 is not met, determine whether condition c4 is met. If condition c4 is met, enter a loop. In the loop, determine whether condition c5 is met. If condition c5 is met, execute activity a_7. After executing activity a_7, determine whether condition c5 is met again. The loop ends when condition c5 is not satisfied. If condition c4 is not met, execute activity a_8. If condition c1 is not met, execute activity a_8.
