Firstly, if condition c1 is met, activities a_10 and a_11 will proceed simultaneously. After that, execute activity a_5 and then activity a_6. 
After completing the branch, determine whether condition c3 is met. If condition c3 is satisfied, execute the following steps: 
1. Determine whether condition c2 is met. If it is met, execute activity a_8. If not, execute activity a_9. 
2. After executing activity a_8 or a_9, return to the judgment of condition c2. This process is looped until condition c2 is not satisfied and then stops.
