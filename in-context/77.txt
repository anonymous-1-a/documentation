First execute activity a_1. If condition c1 is met, determine whether condition c2 is met. If condition c2 is met, execute activity a_2. If condition c2 is not met, execute activity a_3. If condition c1 is not met, determine whether condition c3 is met. If condition c3 is met, execute activity a_4. If condition c3 is not met, determine whether condition c4 is met. If condition c4 is met, execute activity a_6. After executing activity a_6, return to the judgment of condition c4. This process is looped until condition c4 is not satisfied and then stops. After the branch is completed, execute activity a_7, a_28, and finally a_29.
