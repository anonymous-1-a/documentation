First execute activity a_1. If condition c1 is met, determine whether condition c2 is met. If condition c2 is met, execute activities a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, and a_6 simultaneously. If condition c2 is not met, determine whether condition c4 is met. If condition c4 is met, execute activity a_8. After executing activity a_8, return to the judgment of condition c4. This process is looped until condition c4 is not satisfied and then stops. If condition c2 is not met, execute activities a_27 and a_14 simultaneously. Determine whether condition c5 is met. If condition c5 is met, execute activity a_14. After executing activity a_14, return to the judgment of condition c5. This process is looped until condition c5 is not satisfied and then stops. After completing the branch, execute activities a_15, a_16, and a_26 in sequence.
