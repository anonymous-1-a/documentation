First execute activity a_23. Then, if condition c1 is met, execute activities a_4 and a_5 simultaneously. If condition c1 is not met, determine whether condition c5 is met. If condition c5 is met, execute activity a_8. After executing activity a_8, return to the judgment of condition c5. This process is looped until condition c5 is not satisfied and then stops. After the branch is completed, execute activity a_13. After executing activity a_13, determine whether condition c3 is met. If condition c3 is met, execute activity a_13 again. Loop this process and stop when condition c3 is not satisfied. After the branch is completed, determine whether condition c4 is met. If condition c4 is met, determine whether condition c6 is met. If condition c6 is met, execute activity a_19. After executing activity a_19, return to the judgment of condition c6. This process is looped until condition c6 is not satisfied and then stops. Finally, execute activity a_24.
