First, determine whether condition c3 is met. If it is met, execute the following activities: Determine whether condition c4 is met. If it is met, execute activity a_7. After executing activity a_7, return to the judgment of condition c4. This process is looped until condition c4 is not satisfied and then stops. After the branch ends, execute activity a_8. Simultaneously, perform the following two steps: Determine whether condition c5 is met. If it is met, execute activity a_10. After executing activity a_10, return to the judgment of condition c5. This process is looped until condition c5 is not satisfied and then stops. If condition c5 is not met, execute the following activities simultaneously: Determine whether condition c2 is met. If it is met, execute activity a_11 first, and then activity a_12. If condition c2 is not met, execute activities a_13, a_14, a_15, a_16, and a_17.
