If condition c1 is met, both activity a_10 and a_11 will be performed simultaneously. If condition c1 is not met, the first step is to carry out activity a_5. Once activity a_5 is completed, activity a_6 will be executed. Regardless of the situation, determine whether condition c3 is met. If condition c3 is met, perform activity a_8. If condition c3 is not met, execute activity a_9. After completing the above activities, return to continue determining whether condition c3 is satisfied, and loop this process until condition c3 is not satisfied.
