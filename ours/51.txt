If condition c1 is satisfied, start with activity a_1. If condition c2 is met, check if condition c3 is met. If it is, perform activity a_3. Then, continue evaluating condition c3 in a loop until it is no longer met. If condition c2 is not met, check if condition c4 is met. If it is, perform activity a_5. Then, continue evaluating condition c4 in a loop until it is no longer met. Regardless of the situation, activity a_17 must be completed later. After completing activity a_17, execute activity a_18. Finally, carry out activity a_15. If condition c1 is not satisfied, execute activity a_16.
