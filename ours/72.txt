Activity a_1 will be executed concurrently with either activity a_2 if condition c1 is satisfied or activity a_3 if condition c1 is not satisfied. After these parallel tasks have been accomplished, proceed to activity a_4. After completing activity a_4, execute activity a_5. Then, if condition c2 is met, check if condition c4 is met. If condition c4 is met, perform activity a_7. After completing activity a_7, go back and continue checking if condition c4 is met. Repeat this process until condition c4 is not met. If condition c2 is not met, start with activity a_8. After finishing activity a_8, perform activity a_9. Regardless of the situation, determine whether condition c3 is met, and if so, execute activity a_11. Then continue to judge condition c3, loop this process, and end when condition c3 is not satisfied.
