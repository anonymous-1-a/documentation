If condition c1 is met, check if condition c3 is met. If it is, perform activity a_4. Then, continue evaluating condition c3 in a loop until it is no longer met. If condition c1 is not met, check if condition c2 is met. If it is, perform activity a_5. If condition c2 is not met, execute activities a_6, a_7, a_8, and a_9 concurrently. After these parallel tasks are completed, both activity a_10 and activity a_11 will occur simultaneously.
