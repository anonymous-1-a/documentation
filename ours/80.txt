First, carry out activity a_1. After completing activity a_1, execute activity a_2. Then, determine whether condition c1 is met, and if so, execute activity a_4. After executing activity a_4, return to continue to determine whether condition c1 is satisfied. Loop this process until condition c1 is not satisfied. Then, determine whether condition c2 is met. If condition c2 is met, determine whether condition c3 is met. If condition c3 is met, both activity a_8 and activity a_9 will take place at the same time. After the above activities are completed, return to continue to determine whether condition c3 is satisfied, and loop this process until condition c3 is not satisfied. After the above activity is completed, return to continue to determine whether condition c2 is satisfied, and loop this process until condition c2 is not satisfied.
