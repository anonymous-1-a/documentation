If requirement c1 is met, the following tasks will be carried out concurrently:
1. Perform activity a_1.
2. Perform activity a_2.
3. Perform activity a_3.
4. Activities a_4, a_5, and a_6 will all occur simultaneously.

After these parallel tasks are completed, evaluate whether condition c3 is satisfied. If condition c3 is met, execute activity a_8. Then continue evaluating condition c3, repeating this process until condition c3 is not satisfied. After the loop process is finished, proceed to the next step.

If condition c2 is satisfied, perform activity a_9. If condition c2 is not satisfied, execute activity a_10. Regardless of the situation, execute activity a_11 and then execute activity a_12. If requirement c1 is not met, execute activity a_13."""
