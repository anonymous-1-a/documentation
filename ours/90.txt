First, carry out activity a_1. If condition c1 is satisfied, then if condition c2 is met, activities a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, and a_6 will be carried out simultaneously. If condition c2 is not met, check if condition c4 is met. If condition c4 is met, perform activity a_8. Then continue evaluating condition c4, repeating this process until condition c4 is no longer met. If condition c1 is not satisfied, activity a_27 will be executed concurrently with the following process: Determine whether condition c5 is met. If condition c5 is met, execute activity a_14. Then continue to judge condition c5, loop this process, and end when condition c5 is not satisfied. After completing these exclusive processes, execute activity a_15, then execute activity a_16, and finally execute activity a_26.
