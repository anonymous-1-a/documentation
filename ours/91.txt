If condition c1 is satisfied, check if condition c3 is satisfied. If condition c3 is satisfied, perform activity a_2. Then, continue evaluating condition c3 in a loop until it is no longer satisfied. If condition c1 is not satisfied, check if condition c2 is satisfied. If condition c2 is satisfied, check if condition c4 is satisfied. If condition c4 is satisfied, perform activity a_4. Then, continue evaluating condition c4 in a loop until it is no longer satisfied. If condition c2 is not satisfied, execute activity a_5 concurrently with activities a_6, a_7, a_8, a_9, and a_10 in that order.
