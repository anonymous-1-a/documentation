First, carry out activity a_23. After completing activity a_23, if condition c1 is satisfied, start by performing activity a_4. Once activity a_4 is finished, proceed to activity a_5. If condition c1 is not satisfied, check if condition c5 is met. If condition c5 is met, execute activity a_8. After completing activity a_8, go back and continue checking if condition c5 is satisfied. Repeat this process until condition c5 is no longer met. Regardless of the situation, determine whether condition c3 is satisfied, and if so, execute activity a_13. Then continue to judge condition c3, loop this process, and end when condition c3 is not satisfied. After the loop process is finished, determine whether condition c4 is met. If condition c4 is met, determine whether condition c6 is met. If condition c6 is met, execute activity a_19. After executing activity a_19, return to continue determining whether condition c6 is satisfied. Loop this process until condition c6 is not satisfied. After the above activity is completed, return to continue determining whether condition c4 is satisfied, and loop this process until condition c4 is not satisfied. Finally, execute activity a_24.
