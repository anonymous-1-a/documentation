To explain the given input in natural language, we can break it down into smaller parts:

1. Determine whether condition c3 is met.
2. If condition c3 is met, determine whether condition c4 is met.
3. If condition c4 is met, execute activity a_7.
4. After executing activity a_7, return to continue determining whether condition c4 is satisfied.
5. Loop this process until condition c4 is not satisfied.
6. After the above activity is completed, return to continue determining whether condition c3 is satisfied.
7. Loop this process until condition c3 is not satisfied.

Then, execute activity a_8.

Next, there are two parallel tasks that will be carried out concurrently:

1. Determine whether condition c5 is met.
2. If condition c5 is met, execute activity a_10.
3. After executing activity a_10, return to continue determining whether condition c5 is satisfied.
4. Loop this process until condition c5 is not satisfied.

And,

1. If condition c2 is satisfied, perform activity a_11.
2. If condition c2 is not satisfied, execute activity a_12.
3. Regardless of the situation, activities a_13, a_14, a_15, a_16, and a_17 will all take place at the same time.

I hope this explanation helps!
